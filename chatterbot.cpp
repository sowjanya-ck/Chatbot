// the purpose of Chatterbot is to illustrate the concept of 'keyword equivalence'
// Some keywords can be treated the same way because they have the same meaning and so therefore
// we call them equivalent. ex: "HI", "HELLO" are both equivalent because they have the same meaning
// In the current program, we have implemented these feature by modifying the 'records structure'
// Instead of having a single keyword associated on each record associated with a set of responses,
// now we can have more than one keyword per records that are linked to the responses

--initally when the application starts, the bot gets the input from the user and 
saves the previous input which is stored in the variable.
--after that the input text will be preprocessed to remove the punctuation, space
and converts it into uppercasee and also adds the empty string in the beginning and 
end of input
-- once the preprocessing is done, the chatbot checks for some events like null input, user repeatation and all.
if all these condition holds good, it moves to next step of finding the match in the knowledge base

-- The knowledge base is a array of type struct which has two filds , keywords and corresponding responses
The bot traverse through the knowledge base  and finds the match for the keywords and input and returns the
corresponding response of the best keyword.
we use keyword ranking to select the best keywords in the database when there are more than one keywords that match the users inputs.
Each keyword is inserted with space character in the beginning and end to improve the matching process.

The bot is predefined to handle events such as bot repeat, user repeat, null input, same input and similar input etc.
and it will be triggered when the condition is met.
